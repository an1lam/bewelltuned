<h1>Be Well Tuned</h1>
<h2>What's this?</h2>
<p>It's is a very unusual guide to improving your brain and your life:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No bullshit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It doesn't waste your time. Information is given minimally in bullet points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each skill has clear results, with detailed information that lets you evaluate your progress. Pretty soon, you'll know it's real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No religious or mystical connotations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detailed causal models.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you don't like the approach suggested by BWT, you can substitute your own ideas and get equivalent results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also plot your own way though the skill tree. It isn't here to tell you what to do, but rather to give you new, empowering options to choose from.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fundamental level.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's not another bundle of productivity advice, or a miscellany of life tips and tricks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rather, it's about tweaking the fundamental settings of your brain. If you get them precisely right, most other "life advice" will become unnecessary or effortless to apply.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assumes you can think.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The correct approach is probably to keep in mind <em>at the same time</em> that the instructions are broken, and also that there are profound insights that can be learned by trying to follow them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you can learn something, you need to find it in yourself to admit that you don't already know it. You have been warned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The skill tree</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Note 1: all the top-level skills have very, very strong effects. If you learn them, you will have no trace of doubt about whether they work, and about whether they have really improved your life.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Try to also apply this principle of clarity to all sub-skills that you will encounter on the way. Whenever you aren't sure that something is working, assume that it isn't and continue learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you get stuck, bored, confused, or can't make the instructions work for any other reason, <a href="/q_a">get in touch</a>. Or even better, you could pre-register before starting!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note 2: do not fix with cognition what can be fixed with chemistry. Before anything else, your brain is a biological machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic survival.</p>
